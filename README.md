This is a simple Python program that you can use to track your workout training. It utilizes the Nutritionix API to convert human text to proper exercise data. For example, if you type 'I ran for 10 minutes,' we send this to the API and it will return the average time taken and calories burnt.

We are using Sheety API (Sheety is a service that connects directly to your Google sheet, it is used to edit Google sheets) to update workout data in our Google sheets.

Both Nutritionix and Sheety are free to use Sign up and get your API keys
Note: make sure you use the same Google account in Google Sheets and Sheety.
